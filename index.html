        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>The practice of stop and frisk in New York City has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, when law enforcement agencies began employing it as a tactic to combat rising crime rates.</p>

        <h3>Expansion and Intensification</h3>
        <p>Stop and frisk gained significant momentum in the 1990s and early 2000s under the leadership of Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Commissioner William Bratton, as part of the "broken windows" policing strategy. This approach emphasized cracking down on minor offenses and disorderly behavior as a means of preventing more serious crimes. Stop and frisk became a central component of this strategy, with the NYPD significantly increasing its use.</p>

        <h3>Controversy and Criticism</h3>
        <p>As the use of stop and frisk escalated, so did controversy and criticism. Civil rights advocates, community activists, and many residents of predominantly minority neighborhoods raised concerns about racial profiling, excessive force, and violations of civil liberties. Statistics revealed stark racial disparities, with a disproportionate number of stops targeting Black and Latino individuals, despite evidence showing that they were no more likely to be found with contraband than white individuals.</p>

        <h3>Legal Challenges and Reforms</h3>
        <p>The NYPD's stop and frisk practices faced numerous legal challenges. In 2013, a federal district court judge ruled in Floyd v. City of New York that the NYPD's implementation of stop and frisk was unconstitutional and amounted to racial profiling. The court ordered reforms, including the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee changes to NYPD policies and training. Additionally, the election of Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 brought a shift in policing priorities, with the administration scaling back the use of stop and frisk and implementing measures aimed at improving police-community relations.</p>

        <h3>Legacy and Ongoing Debate</h3>
        <p>Despite reforms and reductions in the use of stop and frisk, the practice continues to be a subject of debate and scrutiny in New York City. Supporters argue that it is a necessary tool for crime prevention and public safety, while critics maintain that it perpetuates racial disparities and erodes trust between law enforcement and communities of color. The legacy of stop and frisk in NYC reflects broader discussions about policing, racial justice, and civil rights in the United States. 2</p>

        <h3>Is it worth it?</h3>
        <p>The overwhelming majority of people stopped by the NYPD have been innocent, meaning the NYPD found no evidence of wrongdoing and the civilian was not given a summons or arrested. SQF is now facing controversy being  intrusive and unconstitutional. The use of stop-and-frisk may be justified in high-crime environments, but not when crime rates are low. We should always use less intrusive tactics when possible.</p>

        <h4>”No one should live in fear of being stopped whenever he leaves his home to go about the activities of daily life.”</h4>
